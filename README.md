__AR Chatbot__

This chatbot is made up of a cutting-edge fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality technologies. This innovative chatbot creates a truly immersive and engaging user experience by overlaying virtual elements seamlessly into the user's real-world environment, offering a unique way to interact with AI-driven systems.


The AR chatbot uses the device's camera to merge virtual elements into the user's physical surroundings. This technology enables a mixed-reality experience where the chatbot interacts within the user's environment.


The AR Chatbot not only revolutionizes how users interact with AI systems but also opens up exciting possibilities for education, entertainment, and practical everyday applications in various domains.
