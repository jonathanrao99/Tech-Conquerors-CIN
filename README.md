__AR Chatbot__

This chatbot combines the technologies of Artifical Intelligence(AI) and Augmented Reality(AR). This innovative chatbot creates a truly immersive and engaging user experience by overlaying virtual elements seamlessly into the user's real-world environment, offering a unique way to interact with AI-driven systems.


The chatbot uses the device's camera to merge virtual elements into the user's physical surroundings. This technology enables a mixed-reality experience where the chatbot interacts within the user's environment which opens up exciting possibilities for education, entertainment, and practical everyday applications in various domains.
